# Game of Life in Haskell

## Introduction 
This my project on building Game of Life in Haskell, using declarative programming. I tried making documentation in Haddock format, but failed misserably so a lot of documentation is found inside of the code files. The haddock files are found in `docs/index.html`.  


## Running the application
How to run:
- Run `stack build` to generate executables.
- Run `stack exec myFancyproject-exe` to execute application.
